# Read Paper through Multiple Passes

## 1. Title/abstract/figures
- author tries to summerize in title and abstract as good as possible

## 2. Intro + Conclusions + Figures + Skim rest(skip related work)
- related work is sometimes funny that author wants to cite as many as possible

## 3. Read but skip/skim math

## 4. Whole thingm but skip parts that don't make sense.
- when author writes the paper, but some parts are not important.

## Questions to ask yourself when reading
- what did autor try to accomplish?
- What were the key elements of the approach?
- What can be used for yourself?
- What other reference do you want to follow?
